# Home-med
Home-med is a mobile application that allow users to input symptoms and the application will output the possible disease that the user is experiencing. 
Dataset is tested against python scripts written for decision tree and bayesian classification models with the library sklearn.
As it is a mobile application, our team researched on building and training the ML model for mobile application using the CoreML (on CreateML platform) application, screenshots of settings and results are shown in the .png files. 
dt.py and bayesian.py are the python script files, while .csv files are the datasets used for training and testing. 
Note: all data points used (both training and testing) are the same, .csv files differ due to the different format needed to be input.
